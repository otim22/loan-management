# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x)


Clone the repository

    git clone git@github.com:otim22/loan-management.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd loan-management

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Generate a new JWT authentication secret key

    php artisan jwt:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

**TL;DR command list**

    git clone git@github.com:otim22/loan-management.git
    
    cd loan-management
    
    composer install
    
    cp .env.example .env
    
    php artisan key:generate
    
    php artisan jwt:generate 
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DummyDataSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/UsersTableSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed --class=UsersTableSeeder

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
    
The api can be accessed at [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000).

# Authentication
 
This applications uses JSON Web Token (JWT) to handle authentication. The token is passed with each request using the `Authorization` header with `Token` scheme. The JWT authentication middleware handles the validation and authentication of the token. Please check the following sources to learn more about JWT.
 
- https://jwt.io/introduction/
- https://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html

# Deployment
 
Make you install deployer on your local machine. By running the following 
    composer require --dev deployer/deployer
 
To initialize deployer in your project run:
    vendor/bin/dep init

Add next alias to your .bashrc file:
    alias dep='vendor/bin/dep'

Now lets cd into the project and run the following command:
    dep init

Check a sample of deploy script in the root project called "deploy.sample.php"

To deploy the project:
    dep deploy

Ssh to the host, for example, for editing .env file:
    dep ssh

**TL;DR command list**  

    composer require --dev deployer/deployer
    
    vendor/bin/dep init
    
    alias dep='vendor/bin/dep'
    
    dep init
    
    dep deploy

Please find the deployer documentation below here
